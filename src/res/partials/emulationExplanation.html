    In addition to writing tags, the Tappy is capable of emulating the 
    content you specify here. When the Tappy is emulating content, you will
    be able to scan it using another reader as if it was a tag. If you wish
    to do this, click the 'Emulate' button instead of 'Write Tag.' This
    feature is only available in firmware version 0.51 and greater.
