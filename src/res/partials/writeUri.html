                Writes a single Uniform Resource Idenftifier (URI) record to a tag. 
                When a person with an NFC-enabled Android device taps a tag written with
                a URI, it will attempt to open the resource specified if it has an app installed
                that can handle that type of resource. Most commonly this takes the form of a link
                to a webpage that is subsequently opened in the user's browser (http:// or https://), but it can
                also be one of many other types of URI including email addresses (mailto:), 
                telephone numbers (tel:), sms text messagest (sms:), or even custom URIs
                unique to certain apps.
