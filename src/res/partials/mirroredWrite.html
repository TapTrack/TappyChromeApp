            <div class="md-subhead">
                If you wish to have a tag's unique serial (UID) included in one of your records, 
                you can enable "UID Mirroring" below, which will cause all instances of '[uid]' in
                your records to be replaced with the serial number of the tag the record is being
                written to. For example, if you enter "http://example.com/[uid]" as a URI record and
                write to a tag with the UID "AA00BB11CC22DD33" with UID Mirroring enabled, the record
                actually written to the tag will be "http://example.com/AA00BB11CC22DD33". When using the
                UID mirroring feature, the Tappy will have to flash green twice before a tag is encoded. If
                you remove the tag after the first flash, the next tag you tap will get the message written
                to it with the previous tag's UID inserted.
